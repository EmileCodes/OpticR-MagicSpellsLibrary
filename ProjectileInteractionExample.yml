#Projectile Interaction
# A way in minecraft to trigger spells by making 2 other projectiles hit each other.
#Interactions allow you to create a spell entity that can react different based on what it collides with.

#Config
#entering the lines below into any particle projectile is all you need

interactions:
  - with: InjectionI
    collision-spell: InteractI
    stop-with: true
    can-interact: self 

#With = the spell that's allowed to interact with the original projectile
# collision-spell = The spell to cast when the projectile collides with the projectile mentioned in the line above
# stop-with = if the spell that triggered the interaction should stop after colliding with the initial projectile
# stop-causing = if the original projectile should stop after a spell caused an interaction with it
# can-interact = who can interact with the original projectile

#A stationary projectile that will cause InteractI to be released when coming into contact with InjectionI This projectils is shaped like a 3x3 particle cloud
