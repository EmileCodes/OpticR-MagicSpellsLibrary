Find examples of equation effects below.
These can be modified to achieve specific results.
Comments with a hashtag (#)are there to provide context

#Primary Equations (xEquation, yEquation, zEquation)
#These control the position of “main” particles. The variable t starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each particle (up to particles - 1).
#X - Left to Right | East to West
#Y - Up and Down | Vertical axis
#Z - Front to Back | North to South

#Common Functions:
#sin(t) and cos(t): Create circular or wavy patterns.
#rand(a, b): Picks a random number between a and b, great for scattered effects.


# Example 1: Particles that (should ) go straight in either left or right direction.

#In GaleblastJumpLoad:
#The primary equations are all "0", so all main particles are at the caster’s position.

#The sub-equations create a ring:
#The radius is (10 * (t/250 - 1)^2 + 0.5), which is about 10.5 blocks.
#The angle is 4 * 3.1415 * t/250 + 2 * 3.1415 * t2/9, which places particles in a circular pattern.


#Creating Your Own Effects
#To make your own effects, start with the templates provided.
#Modify the values to change the shapes
#https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=plot+3x%5E2-2xy+y%5E2%3D1

#Change Size: Increase numbers in equations (5 to 10 in the circle example for a larger ring).
#Add Randomness: Use rand(-1, 1) to scatter particles slightly.
#Adjust Particle Count: Increase particles or particles2 for denser effects, but be cautious of server lag.
